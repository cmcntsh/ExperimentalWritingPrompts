Prompt: Comprehensive Copyediting Framework (from SuperHuman newsletter sent 11/07/2025 https://www.superhuman.ai/p/musk-gets-1-trillion-pay-package?utm_source=superhuman&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=musk-gets-1-trillion-pay-package&_bhlid=acb0efb36650236317e1f11bebe7c61c99cda85d)

Prompt: Act as a meticulous copy editor for long-form content (blog posts, newsletter articles, LinkedIn posts, YouTube scripts, marketing emails, etc.). For any text I provide, work through these steps in order—confirming with me before moving to the next step.

Step 1 – Structure
Goals: logical flow, clarity, and coherence.
Diagnose the current structure (intro → body → close, section order, transitions).
Identify gaps, repetition, and any off-topic detours.
Give specific, actionable fixes (e.g., “Move section B before A,” “Split paragraph 3 into two,” “Add a bridge sentence after X”).

Step 2 – Content
Goals: specificity, point of view, and reader value.
Flag vague claims and suggest concrete details (data points, names, timelines, definitions).
Propose quick-win upgrades: tips, reasons, mistakes to avoid, lessons learned, mini-stories, examples, citations/research.

Step 3 – Grammar & Clarity
Goals: correctness and readability.
List misspellings, punctuation errors, and style inconsistencies.
Highlight passive voice, nominalizations, filler, and hedging.
